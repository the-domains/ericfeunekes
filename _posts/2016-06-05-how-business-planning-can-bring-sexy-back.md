# How business planning can bring Sexy Back

Start-ups are about execution.

Without execution, all we have are seeds rattling around that big melon on our shoulders. The Lean Method tells us to fail fast, which means getting a minimum viable product out the doors to see how it works and iterate. Founders work long hours putting together a beautiful, functional product that will make customers swoon. After all that work it's still hard to say if the company will even be around a year from now.

It is difficult, if not impossible (and quite pointless), to spend a substantial amount of time planning for the future. So as everyone else is jumping off the cliff and building their planes on the way down, don't worry that not many of them are coming back up.

Actually, I would prefer to at least have a blueprint before jumping.

Writing a plan down, in whatever form that may take, is a worthwhile exercise for anyone.

# Fighting against our memory means a beat down

As humans, we naturally remember what we did last and what we did first but have difficulty remembering everything we did in the middle. Business plans give us a fuller view of what we've done so that we can better decide what to do next.

Without a plan we can often hold a rough plan in memory; the harder part is remembering what we've tried before and why we made those decisions.

What is it they say about those who don't remember history's lessons? They are bound to make the right choice next time!

# Accountability means improvement

Written plans hold us accountable, they help us stick to the plan, even when bolts are flying off the roller coaster.

How do we know when something has failed? Is it a feeling? Is it a guess? If we write down what we expect to happen and why it will happen that way, we will have something to look back on and consider, whether or not it was successful. That is the experimental method.

# Autonomy means efficiency

Finally, and perhaps most importantly, having a written plan allows our team to work autonomously.

If we don't write down a plan, what happens when an employee needs to know what to do next? They have to find someone who knows and ask.

If we don't write down the plan, what happens someone on your team has an idea? Hold a meeting to get input.

If we don't write down the plan, what do potential investors have to rely on when they're back at the office? Something we told them a couple of weeks ago in a 5-minute pitch.

If, on the other hand, our plan is written down anyone can read it and take action. Employees will know what to do next because they have a plan. Team members will know whether an idea fits the company's mission or not because they have the plan. Investors will know how awesome our company could be because they can read the plan.

# Arguments against writing it down

Despite these points, there are some arguments against writing a business plan.

> Time spent planning is time wasted not executing.

Execution without a plan is like walking into a haunted forest without a pocketful of breadcrumbs. Eventually, every company runs into trouble and needs to turn around. Without a breadcrumb trail, when the company wants to turn around it will end up running in circles.

Might as well jump into the oven and get it over with.

> My company/industry changes too often; I need to stay lean and agile.A business plan would be obsolete by the time I'm done writing it.

If a company is changing so often that a business plan written 3 months ago is totally obsolete, then it probably isn't giving the plan enough time to work.

Just because it's written doesn't mean it can't change.

First, experiments don't give results overnight, they need time. Many try to compensate for poor data early on, but if the test doesn't run its course, there's no way to know whether the poor data were results or just a brief anomaly.

Second, not only can business plans change, they should change---often!

The key is to plan our milestones and then set indicators so that we have a metric to tell us whether or not we are on the right track. For example, break a 5-year plan down, writing a plan for each year. Break this year's plan down into quarters and this quarter's down into months, then weeks, and even days.

This is a technique elite athletes use when training for competitions like the Olympics.

Each time period should have a goal and a metric to measure success. If we hit our targets then everything is good, if not, we adjust the plan (slightly) and keep going.

> I already know the plan; I just make small adjustments along the way.

Remember:

* the plan is for everyone involved in the company;
* without a plan we'll just run in circles; and,
* Where---you sell it (including whom you sell it to).
* How---you sell it.

Sometimes people will want a certain form or specific headings but it's all essentially the same
