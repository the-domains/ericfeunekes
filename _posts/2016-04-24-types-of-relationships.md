The Supreme Court of Canada (SCC) in Bhasin v Hrynew (Bhasin) recently recognized "an organizing principle of good faith."

Good faith is not a breach in itself; rather it is a principle that informs other duties that Canadian precedent (judge-made law) has recognized.

We need to examine situations where courts have already established a duty of good faith to determine what constitutes a breach.

There are two ways to look at this: with a strict interpretation we would apply good faith only in the same type of situation as it has been applied before; in a wider sense we would look at the types of breach that actually occurred, categorize them, and try to apply these too a wider variety of situations. If you haven't guessed it is the second interpretation that we chose to adopt -- the Supreme Court would not have gone to this much trouble if they just intended to confirm what was already done.

Canadian cases have defined good faith in many ways, but generally, good faith can only be defined by what it is not; that is,

**not acting in a way, without justification, that would substantially nullify the objective or benefit that was bargained for by either party**

. This is the principle that organizes other contractual duties. We've identified two duties and the Supreme Court established a third in Bhasin. The Supreme Court also said that the level of good faith required can be varied in a contract and we found that this was reflected in the precedent -- different types of relationships require varying levels of good faith. We identified three types of relationship.

## Good Faith Performance of Obligations

The duty to perform contractual obligations in good faith looks at the way a party to a contract carries out the duties required by a contract. It requires that you

**carry out contractual obligations in a way that will be most likely to give effect to the intentions of the contracting parties.**

Furthermore, if there is something that needs to happen for the contract to work and you are the only one who can do it, even if the contract doesn't require you to do so, you must do it.

This type of thing shows up when someone wants to get out of a contract or tries to find a 'loophole.' For example, if you will soon be insolvent and in order to get more cash for some of your creditors you start ordering more inventory (knowing you won't have to pay for it) you have likely breached your duty to perform contractual obligations in good faith. You took advantage of the contract to do something that wasn't intended.

Remember: a contract is a medium that allows people to express and prove their intention to be bound in a certain way. Common law enforces parties' intentions. Contracts are a good way to prove intentions but a court can overrule the contract or order you to do something that they believe is more in line with the intent.

## Exercising Discretion in Good Faith

The duty to exercise contractual discretion in good faith is the second category that we've identified from precedent. When you are given a choice of how or whether to do something you must at least consider the other party and not act arbitrarily. You don't have to do what is best for the other person and you may do something that hurts them (financially speaking), but you must at least consider multiple options and have a good reason for your choice.

For example, if you have two options, one that will definitely hurt the other person and one that will definitely help them, you may choose either option. That being said, if either option is equally beneficial for you it would be best for you to choose the option that helps the other person. Choosing the option that definitely hurts them is at least arbitrary and potentially malacious.

## Duty of Honest Performance

The duty of honest performance is the third category and was created by the decision in Bhasin.

Justice Cromwell explained "this means simply that parties must not lie or otherwise knowingly mislead each other about matters directly linked to the performance of the contract" (

Bhasin

at para. 73) -- this is the "duty of honesty," as it is commonly referred to in the media. 

The duty of honest performance does not create a fiduciary relationship or a duty of loyalty and it does not require disclosure of information. It is not the same as misrepresentation or fraud. It simply requires that you not lie or mislead other parties while performing a contract.

# Types of relationships

The duties of good faith are the claims you can make to a court; for example, you can claim that you were mislead and therefore the other party breached the contract. The type of relationship you have with the other party will determine the level of good faith required. There are three types of relationship: single transactions, ongoing relationships, and relationships of utmost good faith.

## Single transactions

A transaction between unfamiliar parties with no requirement for ongoing relations has the lowest level of good faith. This type of relationship is exemplified by real estate transactions where the rule is_caveat emptor_: buyers beware. These relationships require the buyer (I refer to buyers and sellers because this is most common in sales transactions) to conduct due diligence for themselves by doing research and asking questions; courts traditionally do not protected those who do not protect themselves.

The duty in transactional relationships is low but still exists. Sellers are bound by the organizing principle of good faith and so must answer questions honestly and do their best to realize the contract.

## Ongoing relationship

Contracts with continuous obligations, that are open-ended, or allow repeat business require higher accountability. Parties in an ongoing relationship are often reliant on one another and have a higher expectation of good faith. Human nature confirms this, we expect more from our family and close friends than we do from a stranger. Similarly, the law demands a higher duty of good faith from an employer and employee than from a customer and cashier at a corner store. 

Ongoing relationships will likely pose the greatest problem for judges and will be heavily litigated in the coming years because they are the most complex; it can be very difficult to tell where the contract begins and ends.

## Relationship of utmost good faith

A relationship of utmost good faith are rare because it requires parties to fully disclose all material facts -- a requirement not seen in either of the other relationships. Insurance contracts are currently the only ones that require parties to act in utmost good faith. These relationships can likely not be deduced from comparable situations, precedent must establish them.

# What about negotiations?

The Supreme Court only refers to the

[][0]_performance_

of contracts in relation to good faith. Good faith

is a claim for breach of contract; therefore, prior to executing a contract there cannot be a good faith requirement. Negotiation takes place before a contract is executed so good faith should not apply -- Bhasin did not create any new requirements for negotiating. This latter point is important because this also doesn't necessarily mean you are allowed to lie during negotiations, there are still breaches in tort (e.g. misrepresentation) that may be brought against someone who makes a false statement.

The important point is**there are no_new_obligations imposed on parties during negotiation**as a result of Bhasin**.**

# How do I use all this?

You know the difference between right and wrong. Don't try to use 'loopholes' to get out of a contract, don't lie or mislead the other party, and don't do something that would harm the other party without at least considering alternatives.

That being said, nothing is certain in litigation. This is our interpretation but what's really important is how judges interpret it in the future; all we can do is wait and see.

A good way to think about this is a quote from your parents: "**If you have to ask, the answer is no**."
