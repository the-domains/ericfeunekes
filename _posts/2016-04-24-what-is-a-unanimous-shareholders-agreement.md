## What is a Unanimous Shareholder's Agreement? 

An agreement between all shareholders in a company. The law affords unanimous shareholder's agreements ("USA") special rights because it is an agreement between \*all\* of the shareholders. 

For example, USA's can be used to force certain shareholders to vote a certain way, force shareholders to sell their shares, and even give shareholders the ability to make decisions usually reserved only for directors

## What you should consider

The most frequent use of a USA is to define the relationship between shareholders. Essentially, if shareholders are to have any rights beyond the three fundamental rights that are given by legislation (voting, dividend, assets on liquidation), they will likely be found in the USA. 

USAs are very common because legislation is incomplete when it comes to shareholder relations--and that's on purpose. Legislators know that shareholders at different companies are going to want to structure their relationships differently, so the law is left open for them to do so. Consequently, USAs are an important part of every company. 

There is no doubt that a USA is important, what you should consider is how you want your relationship with other shareholders to look like: 

* Are you close with other shareholders or will there be investors that you don't know?
* Are there going to be many passive investors (investors who don't actually work in the company) or will all shareholders be active in the enterprise?
* How many shareholders will there be?
* Are you planning a round of investment shortly?

There are too many combinations of rights and responsibilities that can go into a USA to analyze what works best in each situation. 

What you should know is how your company is going to operate and what you think the capital structure is going to be. The more you can bring to your lawyer, the better he will be able to structure your company's USA.
