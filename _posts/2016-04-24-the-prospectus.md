At some point in the start-up journey, likely when you start thinking about raising money, you'll hear about accredited investors; maybe it's from a lawyer or accountant you're working with or perhaps a mentor or co-founder. They'll say you need to find accredited investors, only accredited investors can invest.

The first time I heard this I thought "well how does one become accredited? Is it a course or certification of some kind?" The answer is none of these.

Accredited investors are essentially people who have enough money that they can afford to lose some on a risky gamble (i.e. your company) -- at least in theory. Furthermore, accredited investors are just one of many who can invest in your company, but before we discuss these we need to start at why only some people can invest.

# The Prospectus.

The average person is not sophisticated enough to invest their money in private companies, they must be protected from swindlers and cheats who would steal their money -- so says the government -- thus, we have the prospectus.

A prospectus is a lengthy document (sort of like a business plan) that discloses every detail about a company -- its industry, its products, and most importantly its risks. This allows potential investors to become as informed as possible about a company before they invest.

The problem with a prospectus is that it is very detailed, with ongoing disclosure requirements, and a high level of liability for any mistake that it is impossible for small companies to comply with the requirements. To get around this, securities regulators in every Canadian province have created a number of_prospectus exemptions_, which allow qualifying companies (called_issuers_, because they issue securities) to issue securities without a prospectus.

# Prospectus exemptions

There are a lot of prospectus exemptions contained in hundreds of pages of legislation in multiple documents; for a start-up the capital raising exemptions matter most. Capital raising exemptions allow you to issue shares or debt without a prospectus. There are three general categories of people who fall under this exemption:

1.those sophisticated (i.e. rich) enough to understand the transaction and who can supposedly afford to lose the money;

2.those close enough to the founders to trust them; and,

3.those who knowingly accept the risks of investing in a start-up.

## Accredited Investors

Accredited investors fall into the first category. The list of people who can be accredited investors is very long but those that are most often used in start-up financing is someone who:

\*has $1 million in assets, not including any debt acquired to finance the investment;

\*has a net income before tax of at least $200,000 in each of the last two years or $300,000 with a spouse in the same period; or,

\*has $5 million in assets.

That's it, if someone meets these requirements they can invest as much as they want in any company that they want; although, they do have to sign a risk acknowledgment that essentially says they understand your business may go under and they could lose all their money.

This category is typically used by angel investors.

# A few other Exemptions

Although the accredited investor exemption is very common and very easy to use, there are other ways to find investors.

## Minimum Amount

Someone willing to invest over $150,000 may do so without a prospectus. Apparently the government figures that if someone is willing to invest that much money in a single company they must have done their due diligence.

## Friends & Family

Friends and family of a director, executive officers, or control person (in NB that's someone who has \>20% of the voting shares; collectively I'll call this group control persons) can buy shares or debt of the company. The reasoning is that control persons know enough about the company that they won't let their friends and family buy in unless it is a good investment.

Family must generally be a direct blood relative (parent, sibling, grandparent, etc.) of the control person or the control person's spouse and friends must be close personal friends. The requirement for close personal friend is vague but a good rule is they should be close enough to trust you with thousands of dollars; furthermore, you should have a document written and signed that describes the nature of the relationship (i.e. something that would convince a judge that this person is a close friend).

## Offering memorandum

The offering memorandum exemption like a mini-prospectus that allows_anyone_to invest in your company. The offering memorandum itself is a document that states the objectives, risks, and terms of investment, although not nearly as complicated as a prospectus, you will have to put some work into drafting it -- it's more than just a business plan. Once you have your offering memorandum, anyone may invest in a company if they sign it along with a risk acknowledgement form; both of these must be laid out in a form prescribed by regulation depending on your jurisdiction. 

Because the offering memorandum allows anyone to invest, it is used in situations where you don't want to worry about investors meeting certain pre-requisites and you want to distribute to a large number of people. Note, however, that the requirements are slightly different in the provinces. For example, some provinces place a limit on the amount that can be invested if the investor isn't an "eligible investor," essentially bringing back the investor requirements. 

# Private Issuer Status

Although technically an exemption of its own, the private issuer exemption is more of a catch-all because it allows the company to receive investment from a long list of people that usually have their own exemptions anyways. Accredited investors, friends and family, officers, directors and employees are just a few.

Why have a second exemption for groups that already have their own? Basically, because using one exemption is easier than using more than one. Companies will usually use the private issuer exemption for their first 50 investors (you'll see why below) then switch to other exemptions when they pass the threshold.

To qualify as a private issuer the company must have:

1.50 or fewer shareholders;

2.a restriction on the transfer of shares; and,

3.only issued securities pursuant to the private issuer exemptions.

The first point is straightforward -- to be a private issuer the company needs 50 or fewer shareholders. The second point can be achieved in a number of ways but essentially there must be something in your articles or shareholder's agreement that restricts shareholders from transferring shares. Finally, if you issue shares without using a private issuer exemption (on the stock market for example) you lose that status forever.

# Whose responsibility is all this?

It is the company's responsibility to make sure securities have been properly issued -- meaning the directors and officers (which may be you).

That said, the company can rely on_factual statements_from the investor as to his or her status; for example, the investor should sign a document that confirms his or her status as an accredited investor, personal friend, etc. The document must say more than just "I am a close personal friend" or "I am an accredited investor." Outline why the person meets the standard; with an accredited investor for example, have them write down that they earned more than $200,000 in the last two years (or whatever other criteria they meet).

The investor has to understand what they are signing and what it means. There has been litigation where an investor claims they didn't understand the definition accredited investor and that they don't actually meet the standard -- which is why you should make it explicit which standard they meet rather than have them just check a box.

So what happens if you don't fulfil your duties and an investor isn't an accredited investor? Suffice it to say nothing good. For a start-up, going to court is likely a death sentence because no matter the outcome the litigation fees will be too expensive. You may end up having to give the money back or pay a fine or both.

You are expected to understand all of this before you take anyone's money, securities regulators won't give you much leeway. Don't rely on your lawyers and accountants to do all the work, you know your company and investors better than anyone.
